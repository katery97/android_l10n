'Probability/arXiv2008.12032:abstract' => 'We introduce a discrete-time search game, in which two players compete to find an object first. The object moves according to a time-varying Markov chain on finitely many states. The players know the Markov chain and the initial probability distribution of the object, but do not observe the current state of the object. The players are active in turns. The active player chooses a state, and this choice is observed by the other player. If the object is in the chosen state, this player wins and the game ends. Otherwise, the object moves according to the Markov chain and the game continues at the next period.',
